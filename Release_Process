Thunderbird Conversations release process
-----------------------------------------

1. Sending the addon to Babelzilla.
  - Go to Babelzilla, make a backup of the locales.
  - Upload the addon with all locales disabled (otherwise, overwrites the
    changes that happened on Babelzilla in the meantime).

2. Fetching the translations from Babelzilla
  - Go to the dashboard page
  - Make sure all "download" items are checked
  - Download the locales with missing strings replaced
  - Extract in the locale/ directory
  - Check for new translated snippets in BZ_Localized.txt, add them into
    install.rdf
  - Add missing lines in chrome.manifest
  - Check the encoding of all files:
      find locale/ -type f -not -iname '.*' | xargs file | egrep -v '(UTF-8|ASCII)'
  - Make sure Babelzilla did not mess up backslashes:
      cd locale && ack-grep 0020
  - Make sure Babelzilla did not mess up HTML entities:
      cd locale && ack-grep sendArchive
