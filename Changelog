--- v0.3 development series ---
- Added links to reply (and other actions) to an email in the conversation
directly (it's not necessary to open the message first anymore). You can hold
shift while clicking the links, it will work as expected.
- Added support for viewing messages as HTML (now enabled by default). Many
rounds of improvement. This should be perfectly usable now modulo bug 540911.
- Added folding support for HTML emails, added some heuristics to detect more
types of quotes than Thunderbird does by default (Hotmail-style,
Outlook-style, "----- Original message -----"-style...). Please report any false
positives.
- Many improvements to the way HTML messages are displayed: JS, displaying
images now follow the global content policy, inline images are properly
displayed, HTML is sanitized, and many more...
- Fixes a bug where a thread would be incorrectly summarized as more than one
conversation. This is actually a bug in Thunderbird, see bug 538750.
- Added a small button that allows you to toggle between monospaced and regular
font for viewing plain/text messages. Useful for Bugzilla emails for instance.
- Fixed a bug that would render tab characters incorrectly in plain/text
messages with fixed-width fonts.
- "Mark all read" now also marks your own messages as read. The menuitem was
sometimes incorrectly grayed out. This is now fixed.
- Improve the look of printed messages (many more improvements).

GMail Conversation View 0.3alpha1
---------------------------------
- Added a small paperclip icon next to messages that have "real" attachments (a
"false" attachment is an attachment you can display in the conversation view
such as texts, forwarded emails, old emails, etc.)
- Added a context-menu to the multi message view, that allows you to *print*
conversations. There's an associated "print style". Other various actions are
available through the context menu.
- Added extra buttons (+ preferences) when viewing a conversation : unfold all,
fold all, mark all read, open in new tab. There buttons only appear if viewing a
conversation, not a summary of messages scattered accross different threads.
- Added an option that allows you to focus the first unread message when viewing
a conversation (if all messages are read, focuses to the last message). This
should be working perfectly now.
- Fixed a bug when the add-on failed to retrieve certain messages and displays
"..." instead of the message's text.
- Fix some performance issues (optimize array accesses, remove jQuery animations
as it would considerably slow down unfolding of long emails).
- For GMail accounts, since the same message is in multiple folders, useless
changes of folders were performed when trying to display a specific message by
clicking on the sender's name. This is now fixed.
- For GMail accounts, clicking on a message *you* had sent would take you to the
"Archives" folder. This is now fixed and sends you to the "Sent" folder.
- Fixed some inconsistencies for GMail, such as: in the folder corresponding to
a label, the thread would select the messages in "Archives" instead of the
messages in the current folder, thus sometimes creating inconsistencies
regarding the read/unread status.
- Localized (only en-US for now)
