--- Changes since 2.0alpha1 ---

not covered by the original character encoding).
- Update folder tags when switching folders.
- Add a button to edit / add the contact into the Thunderbird address book
- New 'Send & Archive' option
- Proper quoting support for quick reply
- Make sure the message body is in disabled state while the sending process is
taking place.
- Make the text more understandable in the setup assistant. Don't allow the user
to request changes again.
- Fix issue with font rendering on OSX.
- Make sure deleting messages is undoable.

been appended at the end of the conversation).

- Add links to Google Profiles and Flickr photo pages

- Change 'n' and 'p' keyboard shortcuts to the standard 'b' and 'f' Thunderbird

remaining message from being marked as read.

list).
