--- v0.3 development series ---

- Added a context-menu to the multi message view, that allows you to *print*
conversations. There's an associated "print style". Other various actions are
available through the context menu.
- Added extra buttons (+ preferences) when viewing a conversation : unfold all,
fold all, mark all read, open in new tab. There buttons only appear if viewing a
conversation, not a summary of messages scattered accross different threads.
- Added an option that allows you to focus the first unread message when viewing
a conversation (if all messages are read, focuses to the last message).
- Fixed a bug when the add-on failed to retrieve certain messages and displays
"..." instead of the message's text.
- Fix some performance issues (optimize array accesses, remove jQuery animations
as it would considerably slow down unfolding of long emails).
- For GMail accounts, since the same message is in multiple folders, useless
changes of folders were performed when trying to display a specific message by
clicking on the sender's name. This is now fixed.
- For GMail accounts, clicking on a message *you* had sent would take you to the
"Archives" folder. This is now fixed and sends you to the "Sent" folder.
- Fixed some inconsistencies for GMail, such as: in the folder corresponding to
a label, the thread would select the messages in "Archives" instead of the
messages in the current folder, thus sometimes creating inconsistencies
regarding the read/unread status.
- Localized (only en-US for now)
