#9 Add an option to mark a thread as read when it is displayed
  b) Improve it by only marking a message as read when it is scrolled into view
#12 Extension does not work with newsgroups (throws an exception) (see bug
  478167) --> temporary workaround + check other types of non-mail accounts
#29 Encoding issues (Chinese not ok, Czech not ok either)
#30 Add "reply - reply to all - ..." and other links at the bottom of the
  message, see http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidascher/3095078638/
#8 Add an option to display messages as HTML and not text only
  a) Preferences dialog
  b) Steal code from message display (jsmimeemitter.js sees the HTML go by, find
    a way to catch it with a GlodaMimeMsg)
  c) Adapt "- hide quoted text -" code
#37 KB shortcuts for common operations -> use a global <key /> and
  if ($("#multimessage").is(":visible"))
    $("#multimessage").contentDocument.unfoldAll();

#39 The "Mark all read" command is buggy. Reimplement my own that also marks
messages other than in the current folder as read. MINOR
#38 Add small icon if email has attachment
#32 Detect hotmail-style quoted parts (optional) --> with mime + html ?
#7 Make everything asynchronous. Start filling in messages for the first
  query, then launch the extended query that fetches more messages, and then
  asynchronously insert those in the right place as they arrive (i.e.
  onItemsAdded, not onQueryCompleted).
#14 Assign a unique color to each recipient
  a) Currently using the sender's name as the key, check if there's something
  more elaborate using GlodaIdentity
#19 Font size is set as 12px. Use the Thunderbird-wide preference that depends
  on the lang of the message. --> Do not set 12px but set font to -moz-fixed
  when viewing message with monospace font.
#20 Add a preference to choose the default set of colors for recipients.


BUGS DUE TO THUNDERBIRD
=======================
#10 When clicking on the sender to display a given message, if the message is
  sent by me, and the "Sent" Smart Folder is not collapsed, cannot jump to the
  right Sent folder. WONTFIX (bug in Thunderbird, fixed in 3.1 series, should be
  fixed in the next 3.0 series see
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=536042)
#?? Dates are incorrectly translated (some are, some are not) see bug 537401
#21 Some conversations are erroneously recognized as multiple conversations
  (esp. when you change addresses when replying).
