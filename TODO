#54 Automatically switch to the conversation view when there's more than one
message. Just add an event listener on messagepane for the "load" event, launch
a request and refactor a little to add an extra parameter that switches to
multimessage if we ask for it.
#9 Add an option to mark a thread as read when it is displayed
  b) Improve it by only marking a message as read when it is scrolled into view
#53 Put adjacent blockquotes together (does this ever happen?)
#51 Find a way to hide short quotes in HTML (i.e. less than 3 lines)

#45 Sometimes Thunderbird has not indexed a message... can we force indexing ?
#50 Refactor message display (esp. plain/text) --> use a Necko URL (and use the
 HTML show/hide quoted text code)
#47 0x0019 unicode char makes the innerHTML insertion phase fail
#37 KB shortcuts for common operations -> use a global <key /> and
  if ($("#multimessage").is(":visible"))
    $("#multimessage").contentDocument.unfoldAll();
#7 Make everything asynchronous. Start filling in messages for the first
  query, then launch the extended query that fetches more messages, and then
  asynchronously insert those in the right place as they arrive (i.e.
  onItemsAdded, not onQueryCompleted). There's already that kind of logic in
  selectionsummaries.js and we're currently duplicating it, so maybe check with
  davida or asuth if I can refactor selectionsummaries.js to suit my needs.
#14 Assign a unique color to each recipient
  a) Currently using the sender's name as the key, check if there's something
  more elaborate using GlodaIdentity
#19 Font size is set as 12px. Use the Thunderbird-wide preference that depends
  on the lang of the message. --> Do not set 12px but set font to -moz-fixed
  when viewing message with monospace font.
#20 Add a preference to choose the default set of colors for recipients.


BUGS DUE TO THUNDERBIRD
=======================
#?? Sent messages do not appear in conversations until you open the "Sent"
  folder yourself. Bug 534449.
#29 Encoding issues (Chinese not ok, Czech not ok either, French not ok either).
  Especially the dates. We'll that's a Thunderbird issue (a
  XPConnect/storage-related one) that will hopefully be fixed in the next
  release. See bug 547088.
#12 Extension does not work with newsgroups (see bug 478167) and possibly other
types of accounts
#10 When clicking on the sender to display a given message, if the message is
  sent by me, and the "Sent" Smart Folder is not collapsed, cannot jump to the
  right Sent folder. WONTFIX (bug in Thunderbird, fixed in 3.1 and 3.0.1, see
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=536042)
#?? Dates are incorrectly translated (some are, some are not) see bug 537401
#?? Nasty flickering when scrolling messages with HTML display on. See
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=540911
#21 Some conversations are erroneously recognized as multiple conversations
  (esp. when you change addresses when replying).
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=538750, fixed by the extension,
  Thunderbird patch pending.
