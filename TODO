#6 Launch the second Gloda request ASAP (in onItemsAdded, not onQueryCompleted)
#7 SLOW: make everything asynchronous. Start filling in messages for the first
  query, then launch the extended query that fetches more messages, and then
  asynchronously insert those in the right place.
  +) Performance bottleneck when iterating of the messages' lines. Investigate
  options.
#8 Add an option to display messages as HTML and not text only
  a) Preferences dialog
  b) Steal code from message display (jsmimeemitter.js sees the HTML go by, find
    a way to catch it with a GlodaMimeMsg)
  c) Adapt "- hide quoted text -" code
#9 Add an option to mark a thread as read when it is displayed
  a) Preferences dialog
  b) Improve it by only marking a message as read when it is scrolled into view
#10 When clicking on the sender to display a given message, if the message is
  sent by me, and the "Sent" Smart Folder is not collapsed, cannot jump to the
  right Sent folder.
#12 Extension does not work with newsgroups (throws an exception).
#13 On GMail, useless change of folders (on my account, useless jump from
  caml-list to Archives) when jumping from the conversation view to a specific
  message
#14 Assign a unique color to each recipient
  a) Currently using the sender's name as the key, check if there's something
  more elaborate using GlodaIdentity
#19 Font size is set as 12px. Use the Thunderbird-wide preference that depends
  on the lang of the message.
#20 Add a preference to choose the default set of colors for recipients.
#21 Some conversations are erroneously recognized as multiple conversations.
  Probably a bug in Thunderbird but check anyway.
#22 Localize
